# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Paraphilic Clinic. It's people like you that make Paraphilic Clinic such a great game.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Paraphilic Clinic is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Paraphilic Clinic itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Check whether the  [#help channel on the Paraphilic Clinic Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VWj3Cup) can help with your issue. If your problem is not strictly Paraphilic Clinic specific, [Twine Games on Discord](https://discord.gg/NYvnS6)  is generally more active. Reddit is also worth considering.

## Ground Rules

Responsibilities

* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: TODO
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

## Your First Contribution

Help people who are new to your project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.

Unsure where to begin contributing to Paraphilic Clinic? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Here are some more resources as well:  http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

## Getting started - TODO

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Sign the Contributor License Agreement, CLA, with the Paraphilic Clinic.
    * Note the Paraphilic Clinic Code of Conduct.
    * Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
    * Spelling / grammar fixes
    * Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
    * Comment clean up
    * Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
    * Adding logging messages or debugging output
    * Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
    * Moving source files from one directory or package to another

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email paraphilic.clinic@gmail.com instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
    * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
    * Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

General questions should go to the [#general on the projects Discord](https://discord.gg/GYkAYbY) instead of the issue tracker. The helpers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Paraphilic Clinic is about creating a safe and exciting space to explore and enjoy your kinks.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Paraphilic Clinic, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Paraphilic Clinic has today have been added because our players saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
